# Loan Default Prediction

The **Loan Default Prediction** project aims to leverage data science techniques to assess the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on loans. The goal is to build predictive models that use historical loan data to identify patterns and factors contributing to defaults, enabling financial institutions to make informed lending decisions by accurately predicting the risk of default for new loan applicants.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Loan Defaulter Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/loan-defaulter)

## 1. Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the dataset for analysis.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform EDA to uncover insights, relationships, and trends within the data.
- Visualize key features that might influence loan defaults, such as income levels, loan amounts, interest rates, and repayment terms.

## 3. Feature Engineering
- Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.
- Examples include debt-to-income ratios, loan-to-value ratios, and payment histories.

## 4. Model Building and Evaluation
- Develop various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks.
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve to determine performance.

## 5. Model Deployment
- Integrate the best-performing model into a user-friendly interface for financial analysts and decision-makers.
- Provide clear interpretations of the modelâ€™s predictions and highlight the key factors driving them.
